The main bottleneck of the program when transfering large files is the size of the buffer.
With larger bufferes, more of the file can be coppied at once.
However, the drawback with larger bufferes is the increased time to flush the buffer to the duplicated file.

In contrast, smaller bufferes can only copy smaller blocks of the file at once.
However, file transfers become more frequent.
